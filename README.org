#+TITLE: elci - Emacs Linux Container Interface
#+AUTHOR: jvdydev

Small package to play around with controlling LXC from Emacs.

Only internal Emacs features are used, however external requirements for LXC still apply (=lxc-*= command line tools).

* (Planned) Features
- Interactive view of containers
- interactively create and customize containers
- start/stop/freeze/unfreeze/destroy containers
- send commands to running containers
- Use on remote machines through TRAMP
